# ZomatoNegativeReview
The objective of this problem, assuming that you are working for a restaurant, is to be able to  get alerts(as fast as possible) when a user writes a negative review. Using the API endpoints  available according to the documentation, implement  a solution that will send email alerts on receipt of negative review.
